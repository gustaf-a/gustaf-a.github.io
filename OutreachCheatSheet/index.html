                Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about this?
What do you think is the difference between a dog and a [insert animal]?
Do you think this is necessary? Do we need to kill animals to survive?
Imagine that I have a golden retriever that’s 6 months old. It has the best life possible and I love her. She could become 10-13 years old, but today when she’s 6 months old I really want to eat meat. I could eat something else, but I really like the taste of meat, so while she’s sleeping in my lap I kill her, without any pain. What do you think about this?
I have a card here with a few resources. Dominion is especially important. If I gave you this card, would you think about this and look at it on your own?
